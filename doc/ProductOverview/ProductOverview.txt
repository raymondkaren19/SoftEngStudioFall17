2.    Product Overview
======================

2.1. Product Functions
----------------------

The Inventory Management software is an online product inventory
management application for tracking of a retail store’s inventory,
pending purchase orders, and product backordered status and dates. Use
of the Inventory Management software by a retailer will enable efficient
tracking of quantities, warehouse sourcing locations, low quantity
reorder requirements, and backorder lead time tracking.

The Inventory Management software will be capable of performing all
necessary functions for tracking a retail store’s product on hand. This
will include:

-   Addition and removal of products from inventory

-   Supplier purchase order generation

-   Automated supplier purchase order generation

-   Inventory-on-hand report generation

-   Supplier purchase order report generation

-   Product description management functions

Utilizing the Inventory Management software, inventory tracking can
facilitate automated inventory management based on expected product
reorder lead times versus product quantities within inventory. By
utilizing the application’s automated supplier purchase order generation
features, and based on consumption rate versus lead time, retail
organizations may utilize lean inventory management practices while
minimizing risks of product shortages.

The Inventory Management software will reside on a cloud-based web
server which may be accessible through retail store workstations through
all mainstream web browser applications. A backend database shall
function as the product inventory information repository. Within this
database shall exist the product listings with applicable ordering and
pricing information, and supplier listings with applicable addressing
and payment information.

The web browser interface of the Inventory Management software shall
provide a consistent interfacing for retail store personnel across
multiple workstation platforms and may be accessible through any
workstation providing internet connectivity.

2.2. System, Environmental, And Architectural Constraints
---------------------------------------------------------

### 2.2.1. *Operating Environment*

The Inventory Management software shall operate within a backend SQL
database and a web browser front end interface. Management functions may
be performed by retail store personnel using appropriate logins through
approved web browsers. All major operating systems and web browsers
shall be supported. Workstations shall be required to have internet
connectivity in order to utilize the web interface.

The database server application shall exist on a Linux based x64
operating system. The database server application shall provide hosting
for web socket connections with client workstations.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Table 1.2**

### 2.2.2. *Design and Implementation Constraints*

Each retail store employee must have a unique identifier for use in
login authentication. Retail store personnel shall be required to
maintain a confidential password, which may be reset by the database
administrator.

Cost constraints dictate there shall be a single server providing data
services for all retail store workstations. Retail stores shall be
required to provide internet access to all workstations which require
database access in order to utilize the Inventory Management web
interface.

### 2.2.3. *Corporate Policies, Government Regulations, or Industry Standards*

The Inventory Management software will conform to applicable industry
and government regulations regarding privacy and cybersecurity.

User identification and authentication shall be required and shall
conform to applicable encryption protocols.

Transactions shall be recorded electronically and optionally printed for
retrieval and auditing purposes.

### 2.2.4. *Assumptions and Dependencies*

For the purposes of the Inventory Management software, assumptions have
been made regarding the internet connectivity of the retail store’s
inventory workstations. In order to function, all inventory workstations
must maintain connectivity with the web server in order to access
application functions and perform inventory management.

Training shall be required for retail store managers and shall be
provided upon delivery and deployment of the Inventory Management as a
function of an on-going service contract; in-application help prompts
will be provided for training reinforcement.

6.2. Software Interfaces
------------------------

-   Program is written in Java programming language.

-   The system uses XML as its main form of interchanging data. (Note:
    Can XML be encrypted? Is XML interchange the same thing as
    “exporting data”?)

-   Input of data

    -   Purchase orders.

    -   Inventory Items

    -   Suppliers.

-   Output of data

-   Report generator

-   XML

    -   Purchase orders.

    -   Inventory Items

    -   Suppliers.

-   EDI messages

-   System interfaces with a PDF generator that can be send out to a
    printer

-   Validator

-   Should validate any entered UPC number

-   Address validation

    etc.)

    -   This will be accomplished by storing dates in a standard form
        (such as UTC) with adjustment for local settings.

-   Unit validator. (Rounding Errors preventions)

    -   Note: If the system uses floating point calculations, this can
        be quite challenging.

    -   A solution would be to provide a limit of accuracy

-   Money Validator (Rounding Error Preventions)

    -   Note: If international orders are allowed, will multiple
        currencies be supported?
